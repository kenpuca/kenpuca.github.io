      <description>I am a computer scientist. At the same time, I am also a professor at a small university.
My job description is very open ended. A large chunk of my time is spent on the education of computer science. Normally, I teach four undergraduate courses on a variety of topics in computer science. Given that my expertise is in systems, my teaching is usually limited to systems courses such as Compilers and Databases.</description>
