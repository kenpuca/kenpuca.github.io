      <description>I am a professor in Computer Science at a Canadian university. My job description is very open ended.
Teaching
 A large chunk of my time is spent on the education of computer science. Normally, I teach four undergraduate courses on a variety of topics in computer science. Given that my expertise is in systems, my teaching is usually limited to systems courses such as Compilers and Databases.
