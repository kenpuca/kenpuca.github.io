      <title>Open Data Integration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open Data is the hottest addition to the Web.  Back by various nations and
governments, millions of open data sets are being released by authoritative
sources.  This is a vastly valuable opportunity for data scientists to gain
greater insights into a multitude of social and economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ekzhu/&#34;&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, we are
building an Internet scale data integration system specifically designed for
finding linkages in Open Data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile recommender</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your mobile phone knows more about what&amp;rsquo;s going on than you realize, and
therefore, it should be able to make better recommendations that it&amp;rsquo;s doing now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we are building a new mobile based recommender system that can
safely and privately observe its environment, deduce the situational context,
and make more sensible recommendations to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pixel level visualization</title>
      <link>https://kenpuca.github.io/projects/pixel-packing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are over 1.5 million IMDB movie entries, and roughly the same number of
pixels on a mobile device.  Is it possible to build an algorithm to map each
movie to a single pixel for the purpose of data visualization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking into ways of discovering graph structures based on a relational
database, and then use the graph structure to generate a pixel level data
visualization of (up to) millions of relational entities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stream algebra for computer vision</title>
      <link>https://kenpuca.github.io/projects/vision-pipeline/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer Vision algorithms are challenging to implement. The data input is a big
data stream, and the intermediate processors often require fine tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are investigating the applications of streaming database technology to enable
rapid development, deployment and tuning of computer vision workflow by the
means of formal streaming algebra and structural optimization of algebraic
expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Practical constraint solvers</title>
      <link>https://kenpuca.github.io/projects/constraint-db/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If computers can &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo&#34;&gt;play Go&lt;/a&gt; brilliantly,
why can&amp;rsquo;t we use our mobile phones to solve general puzzles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a great algebra (and an interface) to enable
user access to the powerful constraint solvers.  This project is to investigate
the design and feasibility of such constraint solving interfaces (either as an
application, or a special purpose programming language).&lt;/p&gt;
