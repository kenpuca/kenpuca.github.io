Someone gave me a really gorgeous piece of wood.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what I was hoping to get my hands on.  Given that I have
absolutely minimal experience working with woods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got a steel brush for a few bucks.
The wood is completely dry, and it was surprisingly easy to remove the dusty
layer off the surface with some hard brushing.</p>

<p>The block of wood is full of unique characteristics.  After all, it&rsquo;s these
things that make it so much fun.
This particular piece has a rough corner.  I didn&rsquo;t want to do much about it
except sawing it lightly, and sanding down possible splitters.</p>

<p>I got some wood oil and stains from Canadian Tires.</p>

After a few coats of wood stain and gloss finish, it looks absolutely great.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The legs are from IKEA.  Putting the legs are easy enough.  The wood is quite
soft, and it&rsquo;s really quite easy to drill the guiding holes for the screws.</p>

<p>The only really hard part is that the wood is not perfectly flat, so I had to
put some inserts and adjusted them repeated to make sure that the legs are
perfectly leveled.</p>

<p><em>Finally</em>, it&rsquo;s all done.  Actually, it was so much easier than I thought It
would have been.  I am so thankful that the wood was already nicely polished
to start with.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that this blog is written on the desk.</p>
